## Project Overview

**FlashComm--Light-Comm** explores the fascinating realm of analog communication by using light to transmit audio signals. This project uses basic components like an LED and a photodiode to convert audio signals into light and back into electrical signals, showcasing the practical application of modulation and demodulation techniques to minimize noise and enhance signal clarity.

### Key Features
- **Audio to Light Conversion**: Converts audio signals into light using an LED.
- **Light Transmission**: Transmits the signal via light, which can be captured by a photodiode.
- **Light to Audio Conversion**: Converts the received light signal back into electrical signals and outputs through a speaker.
- **Modulation Techniques**: Implements effective modulation and demodulation techniques to manage signal quality and reduce noise interference.

## Technical Details

**FlashComm--Light-Comm** leverages the principles of analog communication to achieve seamless transmission of audio signals through light. Below are the primary components and processes involved:

### Components Used
- **LED (Light Emitting Diode)**: Converts the electrical audio signal into light.
- **Photodiode/Phototransistor**: Captures the transmitted light signal and converts it back into an electrical signal.
- **Amplifier Circuit**: Amplifies the weak electrical signals received from the photodiode.
- **Speaker**: Outputs the converted electrical signals as audio.

### Modulation Techniques
- **Amplitude Modulation (AM)**: Used to modulate the amplitude of the light signal in accordance with the audio signal.
- **Demodulation**: Converts the received modulated light back into an audio signal with minimal noise interference.

### Signal Management
- **Noise Reduction**: Ensures that the transmitted signal is clear and free from noise interference through careful modulation and filtering techniques.
- **Signal Integrity**: Maintains the integrity of the audio signal from transmission to reception.
